    <h4>Sonnet 116</h4>
    <div>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</div>
    <div>Admit impediments. Love is not love</div>
    <div>Which alters when it alteration finds,</div>
    <div>Or bends with the remover to remove.</div>
    <div>O no! it is an ever-fixed mark</div>
    <div>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</div>
    <div>It is the star to every wand'ring bark,</div>
    <div>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</div>
    <div>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</div>
    <div>Within his bending sickle's compass come;</div>
    <div>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</div>
    <div>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</div>
    <div>If this be error and upon me prov'd,</div>
    <div>I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</div>

    <h4>Sonnet 90</h4>
    <div>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now; </div>
    <div> Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</div>
    <div>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</div>
    <div>And do not drop in for an after-loss:</div>
    <div>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,</div>
    <div>Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;</div>
    <div>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</div>
    <div>To linger out a purposed overthrow.</div>
    <div>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</div>
    <div>When other petty griefs have done their spite,</div>
    <div>But in the onset come: so shall I taste</div>
    <div>At first the very worst of fortune's might;</div>
    <div>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</div>
   <div>Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.</div>
